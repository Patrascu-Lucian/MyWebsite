    <summary>
      Hello! I'm Lucian and I am a web developer and a programmer.
      <details>
      In 2017 I started a journey on learning programming. It took me hard work,
      dedication, persistence and discipline to do it consistently<br>
      - I started learning the basics of programming and OOP with Java <br>
      - I started practicing programming problems, this made me develop a problem solving mindset.<br>
      - I went on to learn UML 2.0 and Design Patterns <br>
      - Then Web Development with: HTML5 , CSS3 and JavaScript (ES6) <br>
      - Version control with Git & GitHub <br>
      - A little bit of C language. <br>
      From the day I started till today I never missed a day of learning/coding, I did it every day.
      I learned a lot these months and I know I'm far from being an expert but I won't end this journey even after I will become one.
