          <summary>About me</summary>
          In 2017 I began a journey on learning programming. It took me hard work,
          dedication, persistence and discipline doing it at a consistent basis<br>
          - I started by learning the basics of programming and OOP with Java <br>
          - Then practicing programming problems, this made me develop a problem solving mindset.<br>
          - I went on to learn UML 2.0 and Design Patterns <br>
          - Then Web Development with: HTML5 , CSS3 and JavaScript (ES6) <br>
          - Version control with Git & GitHub <br>
          - A little bit of C language. <br>
          From the day I started till today I never missed a day of learning/coding, I did it every day.
          I learned a lot these months, and I know I'm far from being an expert but I won't end this journey even after I will become one.
